# Commit history App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The styling of choice was constructed with [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

I followed TDD guidelines for the development of this application, using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E testing, and component testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
